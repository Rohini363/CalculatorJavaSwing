## ▶ Running the Project

### 💻 Using Terminal / Command Prompt

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   Open your terminal (Command Prompt / Git Bash / Terminal) and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohini363/CalculatorJavaSwing.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CalculatorJavaSwing

3. **Compile the Java source file:**
   Compile the main Java file using `javac`:

   javac *.java

4. **Run the application:**
   Launch the calculator with:
   ```bash
   java Calculator

 ### 🧰 Using an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.):

   - You can also import the project into any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

   - Make sure the JDK is set up properly.

   - Add the `Calculator.java` file to your `src` directory.

   - Run the `Calculator` class with the IDE's run button.
